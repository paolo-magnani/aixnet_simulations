# aixnet_simulations
Code to evaluate mass cuts on AixNet (and KAne) data for mass informed dipole analysis.

## Here there is the description of the files:
-  contains the class describing the extraction of mass fractions, plus some utility functions;
- `simulated_dipole.py` contains all global definitions, functions and classes to run the analysis
- `datasets_creator.ipynb` contains the code used to produce the samples and evaluate the best cuts.
- folder `data_results` contains all the final evaluations.
- folder `junk` contains old files and old data sets.
- All the other files in folder `other` are used for creating and plotting an example, that is `simulated_dipole.npy`.
