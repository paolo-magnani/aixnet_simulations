# aixnet_simulations
Code to evaluate mass cuts on AixNet (and KAne) data for mass informed dipole analysis.

## Here there is the description of the files:
-  contains the class describing the extraction of mass fractions, plus some utility functions;
- `simulated_dipole.py` contains all global definitions, functions and classes to run the analysis (marged with old `mass_fractions.py`)
- `datasets_creator.ipynb` contains the code used to produce the samples and evaluate the best cuts.
- folder `datasets` contains all the final evaluations.
- All the other files are either used for plotting an example or result files.
