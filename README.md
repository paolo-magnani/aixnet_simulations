# aixnet_simulations
Code to evaluate mass cuts on AixNet data for mass informed dipole analysis.

## Here there is the description of the files:
- `mass_fractions.py` contains the class describing the extraction of mass fractions, plus some utility functions;
- `simulated_dipole.py` contains the class that describes the dipole on the events
- `optimal_datasets.ipynb` contains the code used to produce the samples and evaluate the best cuts.
- All the other files are either used for plotting or result files.
